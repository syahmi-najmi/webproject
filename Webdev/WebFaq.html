    <p>General Dentistry FAQs</p>
    <button class="accordion"> Why should I go to the dentist regularly?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Many people do not see a dentist on a regular basis. They only go when they have a problem. This is known as "crisis treatment" 
        versus "preventive treatment." While these patients may feel they are saving money, it often ends up costing much more in 
        dollars and time. This is because many dental problems do not have symptoms until they reach the advanced stages of the disease 
        process. An example is tooth decay. It is typical to hear, "Nothing hurts... I don't have any problems."<br><br>   
        Tooth decay often does not hurt until it gets close to the nerve of the tooth. It is not uncommon to see a patient with a huge cavity who has never felt a thing. The dentist can usually detect a cavity 3-4 years before it develops any symptoms. This early detection can help you prevent root canal treatment.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion"> Why should I floss, isn't brushing enough?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Flossing reduces the number of bacteria in your mouth. There are millions of these microscopic creatures feeding on food 
            particles left on your teeth. These bacteria live in plaque which can be removed by flossing. Brushing your teeth gets rid of
            some of the bacteria in your mouth. Flossing gets rid of the bacteria the toothbrush can't get to. That's the bacteria hiding 
            in the tiny spaces between your teeth. If you do not floss, you allow plaque to remain between your teeth. Eventually it hardens 
            into tartar. Plaque can be removed by brushing. Only the dentist can remove tartar.<br><Br>
              Ask your dentist to show you the proper way to floss. You will both notice the difference at the next cleaning appointment.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"> How can I get my kids to brush their teeth?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Make it fun! If you are enthusiastic about brushing your teeth, your children will also be enthusiastic. Children want to do the things 
            their parents do. If your children see you brushing your teeth and displaying good dental habits, they will follow. Ask the dentist for 
            other creative ways to get children to brush their teeth.<br><br>
            Getting your children to brush starts with taking them to the dentist at an early age. All children should be seen by their first birthday 
            or 6 months after the eruption of the first tooth.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How can I prevent cavities? </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Always spend two to three minutes brushing your teeth. It takes that long to get rid of the bacteria that destroy tooth enamel. 
            Do not brush too hard. It takes very little pressure to remove bacteria and plaque. Floss at least once a day. Flossing is the only way to get 
            bacteria from between your teeth.<br><br>
            Watch the sugar you eat. There is sugar in candy, fruits, crackers and chips. These are the foods that the bacteria in your mouth like best. 
            Be mindful of foods like raisins and peanut butter that stick to your teeth. They can provide a constant supply for the bacteria eating into your teeth. 
            Try to minimize the times during the day when sweet items are eaten and brush your teeth afterwards.<br><br>
            If you cannot brush after a meal, rinse your mouth with water - which can help to remove food from your teeth. Chewing sugarless gum after a meal can also help. 
            Chewing deskulates the flow of your saliva which acts as a natural plaque-fighting substance. And do not forget your regular dental visits. Good dental habits will 
            go a long way toward a no-cavity visit.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"> Why does the dentist take X-rays?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Many diseases of the teeth and surrounding tissues cannot be seen when the dentist examines the mouth. An X-ray examination may reveal:
              <ul>
                <li>small areas of decay between the teeth or below existing restorations (fillings)</li>
                <li>infections in the bone</li>
                <li>periodontal (gum) disease</li>
                <li>abscesses or cysts</li>
                <li>developmental abnormalities</li>
                <li>some types of tumors</li>
              </ul><br><br>
              Finding and treating dental problems at an early stage can save time, money and often unnecessary discomfort. X-rays can detect damage to oral structures not visible 
              during a regular exam. If you have a hidden tumor, X-rays may even help save your life. Dentist will evaluate your need for X-rays based on the conditions present in 
              development. There are many benefits to having X-rays taken. Any additional questions or concerns should be discussed with your dentist.
